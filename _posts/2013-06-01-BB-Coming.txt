30th May Morning，I decided to confirm whether my whole night worry was significant. After the pregnancy test showed two lines，I was shocked and nearly fainted.I couldn’t accept it because I had no preparation. we decided to go to the hospital. The result was that I was really pregnant. Oh my god，so big a surprize！
